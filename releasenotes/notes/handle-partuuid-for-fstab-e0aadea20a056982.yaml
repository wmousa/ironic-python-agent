    Fixes handling of a Partition UUID being returned instead of a
    Partition's UUID when the OS may not return the Partition's UUID in time.
    These two fields are typically referred to as PARTUUID and UUID,
    respectively. Often these sorts of issues arise under heavy IO load.
    We now scan, and identify which "UUID" we identified, and update
    a Linux fstab entry appropriately. For more information, please see
